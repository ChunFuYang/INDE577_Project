# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data without explicit labels. The goal is to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures within the data.

## Common Tasks
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation)
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features while preserving important information (e.g., PCA, SVD)
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual data points

## Typical Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Unsupervised learning is useful when you want to explore data, find patterns, or reduce complexity without predefined labels.
