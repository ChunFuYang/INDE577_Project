# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. In supervised learning, each training example is paired with an output label, and the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be used to predict labels for new, unseen data.

## Common Tasks
- **Classification:** Predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam detection, image recognition)
- **Regression:** Predicting continuous values (e.g., house price prediction)

## Typical Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Networks
- Perceptron

Supervised learning is widely used in applications where historical data with known outcomes is available.
