# Neural Networks

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a simple Neural Network (MLPClassifier) using scikit-learn.

## Description
A neural network is a flexible model for classification and regression. The notebook demonstrates its use on the Wine dataset.

## Dataset
- Wine (from sklearn.datasets)

## How to Reproduce
1. Open Neural_Networks.ipynb.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Required packages: numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
