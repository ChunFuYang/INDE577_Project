# Image Compression with SVD

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook implementing image compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

## Description
SVD is used for image compression by reducing the rank of the image matrix. The notebook demonstrates its use on the astronaut image from scikit-image.

## Dataset
- Astronaut image (from skimage.data)

## How to Reproduce
1. Open Image_Compression_SVD.ipynb.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Required packages: numpy, matplotlib, scikit-image.
